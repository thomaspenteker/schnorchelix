Installation / Setup outline
===============================
Image:
===============================
- create a base user 'fpc'
- net-fpc.sh goes to /usr/sbin with permissions (4755) root:root
- disable apparmor (to make tcpdump work) or create a proper profile
- Add to /etc/sudoers (there's a template file within this distribution):
  fpc ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/net-fpc.sh
  fpc ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/tcpdump
- You should disallow password auth and root logins


OR 

- use install-fpc.sh. Defaults: user fpc, IP: 192.168.1.22
  (it uses the template sudoers, sshd_config and known_hosts provided)

Server-side Setup
===============================
- create a template known_hosts containing your server's sshd-fingerprint in the
  same folder as setup-fpc.sh, it will get transfered to the slave box during
  setup to make its ssh(1) shut up
- create a datadir. dumps will be stored in /data/boxname by default
